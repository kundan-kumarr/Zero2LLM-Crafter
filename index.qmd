## Preface {.unnumbered}
his is a collection of lecture notes and practical guides on **AI Agents**, focusing on **large language models (LLMs), agentic workflows, and tool integration**.  
The materials consolidate insights from research and practice, covering the design, orchestration, and evaluation of **LLM-powered agents** across different domains.  

Each section begins with learning objectives, core concepts, and references, followed by examples and hands-on frameworks.  
The notes emphasize **AI design patterns**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **multi-agent systems**, offering both conceptual depth and implementation strategies. They are not intended to replace formal textbooks, but to complement them with **practical, framework-driven guidance** in building **scalable, trustworthy, and adaptive LLM agents**.  

The intended audience is expected to be familiar with programming and the following **LLM-focused concepts and frameworks**:  
- **AI/LLM design patterns**, including:  
  - retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)  
  - agent orchestration workflows  
  - memory and context management  
  - self-reflective and hierarchical agents  
- Frameworks and libraries:  
    - LangChain for composable pipelines  
  - **LangGraph** for graph-based orchestration  
  - **CrewAI** for multi-agent collaboration  
  - **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for interoperability  
- **Evaluation**: methods, metrics, and benchmarks for LLMs and AI agents  
- **MultiModal AI**: integrating vision, text, and speech into agentic workflows  
- **Tool Use & Integration**: connecting APIs, databases, and external environments  
- **Safety & Alignment**: robustness, trustworthiness, and ethical constraints for agentic systems
