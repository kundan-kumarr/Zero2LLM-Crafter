# 🧠 Large Language Models Bootcamp
## #90DaysLLMs [17th June - 25th Aug 2024]

A 90-day hands-on bootcamp designed to equip participants with practical skills in developing, deploying, and scaling applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The program blends theory with real-world applications through capstone projects, live sessions, and tools like Hugging Face, CrewAI, LangChain, and more.
